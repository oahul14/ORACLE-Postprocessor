AOD_angstrom_470_865, unitless, Angstrom exponent calculated from the AOD at 470 nm and 865 nm, is equivalent to the inverse of the slope of the log(AOD) at these 2 wavelengths, -dlog(AOD)/dlog(wavelength)
AOD_polycoef_a2, unitless, ln(AOD) vs ln(wavelength) polynomial fit coefficient (2nd), to recreate aod at other wavelengths use spectral fit equation: log(AOD) = a2*log(wvl[nm])*log(wvl[nm]) + a1*log(wvl[nm]) + a0.
AOD_polycoef_a1, unitless, ln(AOD) vs ln(wavelength) polynomial fit coefficient (1st), to recreate aod at other wavelengths use spectral fit equation: log(AOD) = a2*log(wvl[nm])*log(wvl[nm]) + a1*log(wvl[nm]) + a0.
AOD_polycoef_a0, unitless, ln(AOD) vs ln(wavelength) polynomial fit coefficient (0th), to recreate aod at other wavelengths use spectral fit equation: log(AOD) = a2*log(wvl[nm])*log(wvl[nm]) + a1*log(wvl[nm]) + a0.
