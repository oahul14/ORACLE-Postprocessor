ASSOCIATED_DATA: N/A
INSTRUMENT_INFO: Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer operating in V-mode, with heater near 600 C. This is bulk composition only (no size distributions).
DATA_INFO: Units are micrograms per standard cubic meter (101325 Pa, 273 K). Particle sizes 50 to 500 nm vacuum aerodynamic diameter. Data analyses were performed using Squirrel V1.57l (http://cires1.colorado.edu/jimenez-group/ToFAMSResources/ToFSoftware/)
UNCERTAINTY: 50% for accuracy (pending further calibration work), precision is much better, perhaps 10%.
