# Describing the plots
The vertical profiles0 of CO, OA, BC and CCN were illustrated in Fig. 4 - 7 separated into three subplots as per the corresponding latitude ranges. The concentration of the certain matter refers to the average of its concentration flew by by the flight. In the following descriptions, the three latitude ranges will be referred to as bottom (15S-7S), middle (7S-2S) and upper (2S-1N) parts. 

## Comparisons
### 0828 maxima
The measurements of CO, BC and CCN on 0828 in the middle part showed a rather similar pattern when the maximum concentration appeared. The maximum of different chemicals all peaked at ~4000m (**WHY**). 

### Similar shapes of BC and OA
Despite the insufficient measurements of BC, the observed BC concentrations still illustrated a matching pattern with CO. For example, in the bottom part, both green curves in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 had increased from 1000m and decreased back to the similar magnitude at 3000m. Such a pattern can also be found on 0815, where a small local jag of CO at ~1200m can also be found in Fig. 5. These suggest that BC and CO were, rather than affected by each other, but governed by external factors, such as meteorological parameters (e.g. humidity, temperature, geopotential height) or the input rate of carbon (e.g. wild fires over different terrains). (**WHY**)

## CO
The measurements of CO showed the most continuous pattern on Fig.4. Similar curves can be seen on 0812, 0813 and 0824 in the bottom part where the maximum CO concentration was no larger than 250 ppbv. 

### Peak position (0812 - 0826)
An observable pattern of CO is the appearance of maximum concentration at certain altitudes. On all six days, a peak of CO was found across the vertical profile. Such the pattern is most noticeable in the upper part, where the maximum CO appeared to lift in altitude and decreasing in magnitude from 0812 to 0826 (the measurement of 0824 did not cover the upper part, though). A rebound of CO concentration was present in the bottom part on 0812 and 0824, where the CO concentration oscillated from ~240 ppbv at ~1200m to less than 150 ppbv at ~1800m between 1000m to 3000m. 

### Overall magnitude (0812 0815 0824 0826)
The CO concentration shifted with respect to latitude as well. On 0812, 0815, 0824 and 0826, the overall CO concentration increases and the maximum concentration becomes more clear as the flight flew from the bottom to the upper part. (**WHY**)

### 0828
The maximum of CO concentration across the six-day measurements was observed on 0828 at 500ppbv at the middle part. It was surprising to find that in the upper part on 0828, no peak CO concentration was detected below 4000m; by comparison, on 0812, 0813, 0815 and 0826, the maxima in the upper part all appeared between 2000 to 4000m. (**WHY**)

## BC
The measurement of BC suffered from a considerable loss of valid data, and therefore only local patterns can be observed. On 0813 and 0828, the partially available curve showed a similar trend to CO both in location and magnitude, respectively. 

## CCN
## Bottom part
On 0812, 0813 and 0815 in the bottom part, a shift of maximum CCn concentration was decreasing both in magnitude and altitude. From 0812 to 0813, a dual maxima pattern between 1500m and 2500m was smoothed and shift to the bottom left. On 0824 in the same area, the CCN number concentration had decreased to less than 250 -m3. 

## 0828
A peak at 4000m can be observed both in the bottom and the middle part, whereas the magnitudes were ~1800 -m-3 and ~1200 -m-3, respectively. It worth noticing that data on Fig.6 has depreacated data measured in clouds. This suggested a meridian  (经向的) distribution of CCN which could contribute to the formation of clouds in the future days.  (可以找一下0828之后几天的云图，看一下云的分布和0828飞机飞行轨迹的关系)

## OA
The measurements of OA were only available on 0813, 0815, 0826 and 0828. Measurements on 0813 and 0815 were relatively more convincing as they have less invalid data. From the bottom part to the upper part, the maximum mass concentrations of OA increased in magnitude. On 0813, the maximum mass concentration oscillated around 20 mg/m3, which increased to 60 mg/m-3 at largest. The occurrence of high concentration altitude of increased from south to north. On 0815, a similar oscillation happened at a slightly lower position in the bottom part, which wobbles around 30 mg/m3.
